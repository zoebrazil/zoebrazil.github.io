<p style="font-size:25px;">Art history has been dominated by white men for a large portion of history. But everyone can agree that artists are not just white men. Because of the disproportionate wealth in the white community, white people are able to focus the topics of art history to white artists. There are of course art history courses that focus on BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, People of Color) artists, but those course are typically add on electives. The major art history courses need to shift towards a more inclusive curriculum. </p>

<p style="font-size:25px;">Following the events of George Floyd’s death and mainstream rise of the BLM movement, many BIPOC artists began to raise the issue of inclusiveness. On June 18, 2020 , Juan José Amaya (@juan.amaya) posted on Instagram a series of graphics titled “Let’s Address White Supremacy in the Art Community”. He addresses that the art community is predominantly viewed as a white community, even when there are plenty of BIPOC artists within it. Amaya states “There’s not enough POC, especially Black and Indigenous folks, in the art world…artists, curators, gallery owners, professors. They’re all systemically underrepresented”.</p>

<p style="font-size:25px;">In this website, I would like to continue with Juan José Amaya’s message and help educate other about Black artists. Before Amaya’s post, I had only heard of two of the twenty-eight artists he mentions. As a white artist myself, I am ashamed at the lack of inclusiveness in the art community. Art history needs to be inclusive, diverse, and not split into special electives for BIPOC art.</p>
