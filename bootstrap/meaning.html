This interactive video series is an abstract narrative about mental health and what happens 
when different factors affect a person with mental health struggles. I want this project 
to be a reflection of my own struggles with mental health. I hope shed a light on how there 
are so many factors that can lead to a person’s struggle with mental health. And sometimes 
a person suffers when there are no environmental stresses.

The options are “Water”, “Do Nothing”, and “Fire”. The water represents inner turmoil within 
a person. When someone is fighting within themself, it feels as if they are drowning. They feel 
their world slowly shrink until they are unable to function normally. But sometimes people on 
the outside cannot see this inner struggle. The do nothing represents how easily outsiders 
can ignore those with mental health struggles. As long as the person who is struggling is presenting 
a normal façade, no one can tell what is going on inside. It is easy for outsiders to not ask 
the hard questions and check up on those who are struggling. The fire represents a traumatic life event. 
It is difficult enough to handle mental health without something traumatic adding onto the fire. 
Some traumas are manageable, but others are not.
